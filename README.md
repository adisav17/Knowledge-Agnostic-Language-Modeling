# knowledge-agnostic-language-modeling

We develop frameworks which work on the union of language models and knowledge representation.
We aim to separate syntax and semantics, use semantic abstractions for language modeling, in view of reducing model and sample complexity,
enabling interpretability and generalization. 
The first phase of the project is centered around representing named entity types and an ontology of the same. 
We also work in entity sense discovery, we develop entity sense embeddings and sentencial representations in view of optimal entity sense configurations.
